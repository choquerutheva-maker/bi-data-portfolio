## 👋 About Me
My professional journey has been deeply rooted in Business Intelligence and data analysis for over 12 years. As a Systems Engineer, I have built a strong foundation in advanced SQL, working extensively with Oracle and SQL Server to design optimized queries, stored procedures and ETL processes for data cleansing, integration and reliable reporting.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with business teams to transform complex and fragmented data into structured, governed and trustworthy information. Data quality, consistency and governance have always been central to my work, as I strongly believe that meaningful insights start with well-prepared data.

I also have extensive experience developing interactive dashboards and analytical solutions using Power BI and Tableau, focusing on usability, storytelling and decision-making impact rather than just visuals.

Alongside my BI expertise, I am continuously strengthening my knowledge in cloud-based data platforms and modern data practices. This learning journey complements my BI background, allowing me to design more robust, scalable and future-ready analytical solutions, while remaining fully committed to delivering high-quality Business Intelligence outcomes.
